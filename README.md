# magnitude-comparator
🎯 Introduction

A Magnitude Comparator is a combinational circuit that compares two binary numbers and determines their relative magnitudes. It outputs whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.

For example, comparing two 4-bit numbers A and B:

A > B → Output: 1

A < B → Output: 1

A == B → Output: 1


𝐴=𝐵
A=B (Equal)

𝐴>𝐵
A>B (Greater)

𝐴<𝐵
A<B (Less)

 The number of combinations for each case!
